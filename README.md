# Sudoku
## Mechanics
- The game has 2 modes: pencil and write.
- Pencil mode allows the player to try out multiple values on the squares
- Write mode inputs a value that will be checked against the solution.
- To toggle game modes, press M.
- If the number you write (in write mode) is incorrect, certain squares will be highlighted red.
- If your mistake is caused by a duplicate value in a row/column/subgrid, then the these duplicates will be highlighted.
- Else, your answer was not a part of the original solution. In this case, the current selected square will be highlighted red (although it will look grayish purple since the blue and red mix).
- At any time, you can press SPACE to reveal the solution, or R to restart.
